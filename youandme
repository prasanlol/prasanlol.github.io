When I'm with her, I get the best feeling in the world which makes me want
her more and more. That's why I try to go out with her a lot, and get upset
when she says no and decides to sleep or whatever. She makes me believe I am
the most luckiest man in the world because I have a girlfriend who is not only
smart but also the most beautiful girl I've ever got a chance to meet. She also
makes me wanna dream big and have big hopes for our future.

I know with you by my side everythings gonna be alright. All the people that talk about us
they can say what they like cause it isn't gonna change our relationship.

Thank you for being in my life - I LOVE YOU
