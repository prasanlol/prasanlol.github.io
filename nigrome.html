What up dawg. I wrote this message when we hit our 1 month it's been sitting on my computers desktop ever since.
Now I think it's time for you to see it. I'm sorry that I act so "rude", "mean", or "angry" I don't do it intentionally. 
I probably sound like a little cringe ass bitch in this note but it's okay, and I hope you don't share this with
anyone. I'd like it to stay between you and I.

I said "I gave up on school" but the truth is in my 9th and 10th grade years I was really sad and depressed.
I don't really think my friends from akron know about this either. I kept most of my feeling to myself. 
9th grade seemed like one of my loneliest years. I never really talked to anyone and a lot of shit went wrong. 
I kept making a shit ton of mistake and one of them resulting in issues with my dad's stuff which I don't wanna get into.
Overall I felt like a completely failure and a disappointment. I would just wake up sit and do nothing in school and come home
and drown myself in my computer. Which really killed me deep inside and made me feel even worse. I started failing in school
which put even more pressure on me which made me feel even more like a disappointment. 

When I went to 10th grade I thought everything would be different, I was gonna get good grades and be a 3.5+ gpa student. I was doing
great the first grading period until I had to move to Watkins. When I came to watkins I knew nobody, I felt alone again. From then to the beginning of 
summer I was horrible at school. I knew nobody, I was failing classes, and my emotional health wasn't good. I did terrible things to myself, started to overthink
a lot. Never was open to anyone, and I was hurting myself emotionally and physically aswell (kinda sounds stupid when I look back at it). During this time I really wanted
to just be alone and end it. I remember 9th grade year I tried to end it by taking random pills I found but that didn't work out. Before
I moved I thought it would be a fresh start, But I really regretted moving from akron cause I thought atleast in akron I had people I knew who I could go hangout with when
I felt alone or sad.

During summer I met you, this was when I started being more social and etc. You were the first person who I met that made me feel like moving here wasn't that bad.
Which I wanna really thank you for that because it really did change me a lot, even thought I still have a lot of flaws. I am sorry if I get upset a lot when we hangout.
Whenever you go home it makes me sad. Whenever I get sad I tend to overthink a lot thats why I always look mad and upset. I want you to know it isn't your fault. Whenever 
you cancel hangingout or say you can't it makes me a little sad but I understand why you can't or whatever.


I just want you to know that I'm tryna better myself and my mind but it gets hard sometimes because past memories just come flooding back which make me 
wanna hurt myself even more knowing how stupid I was. I am sorry if I overthink a lot aswell I'm just really insecure about myself. Whenever I start to overthink it's never good and I end
up just showing the anger and the frustrations towards people around me, Example being my parents, my siblings. It hurts me deep inside and I try to better myself but it never seems to work.
I am not used to sharing things openly and there's a lot of things people like kumar dhai and etc don't know about me especially the ending my life bs.
I hope you understand this note/message, it's mostly telling you why I act the way I act.

Most importantly I love you and I hope
you stay by myside through the anger, the arguements, the petty shit. I truely do love you even though it doesn't seem like it sometimes.
