    <p>Hey baby, I just wanted to send you this just to tell you my thoughts.</p>
    <p>I am sorry for acting terribly and always seeming angry. I know it does hurt your feelings whenever I go on my little temper tantrums. And I want you to know that I never would do it to hurt you. It's just that I sometimes get annoyed at the most simplest stuff and I'm trying to control it.</p>
    <p>I also don't find you annoying, whenever we talk or text each other it makes me happy even when I'm in a bad mood. Every day we spend together is worth all my time. Whenever you send me photos and snaps I think to myself how I got so lucky to have you as my girlfriend.</p>
    <p>I just wanna let you know I am a very insecure person and sometimes it gets bad. That's also another reason why I get annoyed. I always seem to compare myself to others. It hurts me but I want you to know that it'll never come between our relationship.</p>
    <p>I know I say this too much, but I LOVE YOU and I am happy we met.</p>
    <p>Happy 2 months - Prasan</p>
