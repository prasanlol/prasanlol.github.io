Hey baby, I just wanted to send you this just to tell you my thoughts.
I am sorry for acting terribly and always seeming angry. I know it does hurt your feelings 
whenever i go on my little temper tanrums. and I want you to know that
I never would do it to hurt you. It's just that I sometimes get annoyed at the 
most simpliest stuff and i'm trying to control it. I also don't find you annoying, whenever we
talk or text each other it makes me happy even when I'm in a bad mood. Everyday we spend together
is worth all my time. Whenever you send me photos and snaps I think to myself how i got so lucky to
have you as my girlfriend.

I just wanna let you know I am a very insecure person and sometimes it gets bad. That's also another
reason why I get annoyed. I always seem to compare myself to others. it's hurts me but I want you to 
know that it'll never come between our relationship.

I know I say this too much, but I LOVE YOU and I am happy we met.

happy 2 months - Prasan
