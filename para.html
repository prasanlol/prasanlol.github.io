      Hello, baby. I'm sorry I couldn't give you the thing at 12 am, but nevertheless, happy National Girlfriend Day.<br><br>
      I love you so much, and you've made the time we've been together one of the best times in my life.<br>
      I hope our relationship grows even closer as time goes on.<br>
      Even though you try to get mad at me for the dumbest reasons, I still love you, and I will never let that stuff break us apart.<br>
      Whenever you text my phone or call me, my heart just starts exploding with happiness.<br>
      I have so many other ways to tell you how you make me feel and how much I love and appreciate you being here for me, 
      but it's 1:46 am, and I'm tired lol.<br><br>
      <strong>I LOVE YOU SOO MUCH! - Prasan</strong>
